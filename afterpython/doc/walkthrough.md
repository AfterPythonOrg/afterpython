# Walkthrough
After initialization, the following directories are created:
- `afterpython/`
- `afterpython/doc/`
- `afterpython/blog/`
- `afterpython/tutorial/`
- `afterpython/example/`
- `afterpython/guide/`

The `afterpython/` directory is the main directory that contains all content, while the subdirectories are initialized by `myst init` (see [MyST Markdown]).

> Note that [NodeJS] and [pnpm] will be installed for you by default if they are not already installed
